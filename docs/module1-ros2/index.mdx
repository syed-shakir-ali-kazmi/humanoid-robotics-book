# Module 1: The Robotic Nervous System (ROS 2)

## Overview

Welcome to Module 1! In this module, you'll learn how ROS 2 (Robot Operating System 2) acts as the "nervous system" for humanoid robots. Just like your nervous system helps your brain control your body, ROS 2 helps AI systems control robot hardware.

### What You'll Learn

By the end of this module, you will understand:

- What ROS 2 is and why robots need it
- How ROS 2 connects different robot parts (sensors, AI, motors)
- The three ways robot parts communicate (topics, services, actions)
- How Python AI code talks to robots using rclpy
- How robots describe their physical bodies using URDF

### Who This Module Is For

This module is designed for:
- Students learning AI and robotics
- Engineers transitioning into Physical AI
- Anyone curious about how humanoid robots work

**No coding or hardware required!** This is about understanding concepts, not building robots.

### Module Structure

This module contains 5 chapters:

1. **[Introduction to ROS 2](./chapter1-introduction.mdx)** - Discover what ROS 2 is, why humanoid robots need middleware, and how it acts like a nervous system coordinating sensors, AI, and motors.

2. **[Nodes: The Building Blocks](./chapter2-nodes.mdx)** - Learn how nodes are independent programs that each do one job well. Explore modularity, fault tolerance, and why separating concerns makes robot systems robust.

3. **[Communication Patterns](./chapter3-communication.mdx)** - Master the three ways nodes communicate: topics for streaming data, services for request-response queries, and actions for long-running tasks with feedback. Understand Quality of Service (QoS) tradeoffs.

4. **[Connecting AI with rclpy](./chapter4-rclpy.mdx)** - See how Python AI code becomes a ROS 2 node using rclpy. Discover why Python dominates AI, and how rclpy bridges AI frameworks like PyTorch with robot hardware.

5. **[Describing Robot Bodies with URDF](./chapter5-urdf.mdx)** - Understand how robots describe their physical structure using links (rigid parts) and joints (connections). Learn how URDF enables simulation, visualization, and motion planning.

**Estimated Time**: 25-35 minutes total (6,800 words)

### Prerequisites

Before starting this module, you should have:
- Basic understanding of Python (can read simple code)
- High-level knowledge of AI/machine learning concepts
- Familiarity with everyday computer terms (programs, files, processes)

### Learning Approach

Each chapter includes:
- **Clear learning objectives** - Know what you'll master
- **Simple explanations** - Complex ideas explained simply (5th-6th grade reading level)
- **Visual diagrams** - Pictures that clarify concepts
- **Humanoid robot examples** - Real-world scenarios you can imagine
- **Learning checkpoints** - Questions to test your understanding

### Let's Begin!

Ready to learn how AI connects to the physical world? Start with [Chapter 1: Introduction to ROS 2](./chapter1-introduction.mdx) to discover the nervous system of robots!

**Module Goal**: By completing this module, you'll understand how ROS 2 enables Physical AI - how intelligent systems become embodied in humanoid robots that can sense, think, and act in the real world.
