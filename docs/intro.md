# Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics Textbook

Welcome to the Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics textbook - a comprehensive guide to understanding how humanoid robots work, from basic robotic nervous systems to advanced vision-language-action models.

## About This Textbook

This textbook focuses on **systems understanding** rather than implementation. You'll learn how Physical AI systems work, how components connect, and why design decisions matter - all without needing expensive hardware or complex lab setups.

### Core Principles

- **Accessible**: Written at a 5th to 6th grade English reading level
- **Visual**: Diagrams and examples illustrate every concept
- **Practical**: Every topic connects directly to humanoid robotics
- **Modular**: Self-contained modules build on each other logically

## Modules

### Module 1: The Robotic Nervous System (ROS 2)
Learn how ROS 2 provides the foundational communication layer for humanoid robots, including nodes, topics, services, and action servers.

### Module 2: The Digital Twin (Gazebo & Unity)
Understand physics simulation, sensor simulation, and visualization for testing robots in virtual environments before deploying to hardware.

### Module 3: The AI-Robot Brain (NVIDIA Isaac)
Explore Isaac Sim, Isaac ROS, VSLAM, and Nav2 for perception, navigation, and autonomous decision-making.

### Module 4: Vision-Language-Action (VLA)
Discover how Large Language Models enable humanoid robots to understand natural language commands and translate them into physical actions using OpenAI Whisper and cognitive planning.

## Getting Started

Navigate to any module using the sidebar to begin learning. Each module is designed to be independently readable while building on concepts from previous modules.
