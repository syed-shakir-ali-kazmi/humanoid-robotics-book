# Specification Quality Checklist: Module 4 - Vision-Language-Action (VLA)

**Purpose**: Validate specification completeness and quality before proceeding to planning
**Created**: 2025-12-05
**Feature**: [spec.md](../spec.md)

## Content Quality

- [x] No implementation details (languages, frameworks, APIs)
- [x] Focused on user value and business needs
- [x] Written for non-technical stakeholders
- [x] All mandatory sections completed

## Requirement Completeness

- [x] No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers remain
- [x] Requirements are testable and unambiguous
- [x] Success criteria are measurable
- [x] Success criteria are technology-agnostic (no implementation details)
- [x] All acceptance scenarios are defined
- [x] Edge cases are identified
- [x] Scope is clearly bounded
- [x] Dependencies and assumptions identified

## Feature Readiness

- [x] All functional requirements have clear acceptance criteria
- [x] User scenarios cover primary flows
- [x] Feature meets measurable outcomes defined in Success Criteria
- [x] No implementation details leak into specification

## Validation Results

**Status**: ✅ ALL CHECKS PASSED

**Validation Date**: 2025-12-05

**Key Findings**:
- Spec appropriately focuses on module content requirements (what to teach about VLA) rather than system implementation
- All 3 user stories (Understanding convergence, Voice-to-action, Cognitive planning) are independently testable with clear priorities
- Success criteria are measurable and focused on reader outcomes (comprehension, motivation)
- No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers remain; all requirements are unambiguous
- Scope clearly bounded with 8 in-scope items and 11 out-of-scope items
- Edge cases appropriately address prerequisite knowledge gaps and varying reader backgrounds

**Ready for**: `/sp.clarify` or `/sp.plan`

## Notes

- All checklist items validated and marked complete
- Spec is ready for planning phase without requiring updates
